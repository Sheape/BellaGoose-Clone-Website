# BellaGoose Coffee and Roastery

This is our Final Project for our 2nd year of 
high school. We are assigned to redesign a 
website based on our categories set in. This website is pushed into this repository
a year after the submission because I learned 
about Git and Github at this time.

This are the following requirements that are given
to us:

- Offline Support (Assets such as fonts, images, svg, etc.)
- Wix is not allowed
- Own understanding about HTML and CSS (since she teached us about the basics only)
- The business must be in the local area (Angeles City, Pampanga)
- Media Queries isn't necessary
- It mustn't be published in the internet.

## Thoughts

She thought us about the old frameset and not the modern flexbox and grid layout. No standards and strategies mentioned. However at this time, I was advanced in HTML and CSS but I wasn't able to pick up javascript that much. This project is collaborative and I wanted to credit my teammates Becky Quiambao and Czelrina Cortez for the help and motivation. They provided me with resources and assets while I wireframe and coded it.

## Review

I reviewed and checked the website's code after a year. I learned java and Object-Oriented Programming at that year. I realized that the UI and UX design perspective of it is not that good and so this github repo will change that. I will redesign our website once again.
