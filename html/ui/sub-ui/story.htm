        <p class="paragraph-story"> 
            As Jay Heesch rode donkey-back up the mountains of Costa Rica, he was inspired by the coffee huts along the path. Though the coffee was
            exceptional, Jay was most impressed with the way the coffee huts created community. It was here that people gathered to share their stories,
            care for one another, and find a place of belonging. All along the mountain, hut after hut, community was made. Jay came back and together
            with our team set out to make exceptional craft coffee in a place of belonging and care for a community. In 2013 Bella Goose Coffee was born.
        </p>
    
        <p class="paragraph-story">
            That year, Jay's son, Jordan, purchased a Gene Cafe 8 oz coffee roaster and began very small batch roasting. His first method of selling coffee
            was really fun, but short lived. He'd call up his friends and family, figure out just how much coffee they intended to drink, and after roasting,
            he'd drive it over to their houses. This turned out to be a fraught business model for a number of reasons, one being that Jordan would spend
            most his afternoons sitting and talking with the customers with every drop off.

        <p class="paragraph-story">
            Soon, two friends joined the Heesch's and together the 6 founders had a crazy dream of opening a cafe. Those friends ended up getting married to
            each other, and are now the directors of the headquarters in Wisconsin Dells. All of the renovation, menu creation, and design was done with that
            team's blood, sweat, and tears. The Bella Goose Headquarters opened in September of 2014.
