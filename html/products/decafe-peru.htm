Certified up the wazoo and tasty as can be - this is one of the higher rated decafs we have had through our doors, very sweet clean and rich - one you decaf drinkers will not want to miss - tasty enough to even keep you caffeinated drinkers happy! 
Peru is one of the largest producers of coffee in the world and is noted as one of the major producers of fair trade and organic coffees. This organic coffee comes from the farmers of the Piuran mountain range. 
This is one tasty decaf! Very rich and smooth with a nice creamy chocolate undertone and very fresh! A hint of acidity gives the cup a crisp feel. 
<br>
<br>
Tasting Notes: <br>
A very chocolaty cup, pretty smooth but still closer to bakers chocolate than milk chocolate. It has a little caramel sweet floral tone upfront that creates a very nice balance of tones. Although very low acidity this cup does have some very nice jazzy lighter tones. <br>
