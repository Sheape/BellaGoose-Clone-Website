Colombia Popayan Supremo is sourced from family-owned farms located in the municipality of Popayán within the department of Cauca, Colombia. On average, each producer cultivates their coffee on less than 5 acres of land. Coffee producers use their own micro-mill to process harvested cherries, which allows for meticulous care in depulping, fermenting, and drying the coffee. Expocafé, an exporter dedicated to supporting small producers, collaborates with these producers improving their access to international markets and establishing higher earnings.

Tasting Notes: <br>
The aroma of this coffee is very nice; sweet with with a little spice floral tone. It is pretty classically toned for a Colombian; semi-dry toasted walnut overtone turning a bit more molasses/caramelly into the darker roast points.  Very balanced, subtle spice, clean and rich with a nice new crop crisp acidity.
